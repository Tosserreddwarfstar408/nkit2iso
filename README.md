# nkit2iso

Convert **GameCube and Wii** `*.nkit.iso` (and GCZ-compressed `*.nkit.gcz`)
disc images back to plain, bit-exact `.iso` files that emulators (Dolphin,
Nintendont, …) can boot.

`nkit2iso` is a single, dependency-free static binary written in Go. It restores
the shrunk NKit v01 format by replaying the preserved data and regenerating the
removed "junk" padding — and, for Wii, the AES encryption and the H0–H3 hash
tree — then verifies the result against the original CRC32 stored inside the
NKit header, so a successful run is **redump-verified 1:1**.

```
$ nkit2iso -i "Mario Kart - Double Dash!! (USA).nkit.iso"
Restoring Mario Kart - Double Dash!! (USA).nkit.iso -> Mario Kart - Double Dash!! (USA).iso
  100%
CRC32 099E2C6D  MATCH (redump-verified)
```

## Install

Download the archive for your platform from the
[Releases](https://github.com/DonMikone/NKIT-Converter/releases) page and unpack
the `nkit2iso` binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|-------|
| Windows (x64) | `nkit2iso_<ver>_windows_amd64.zip` |
| Linux (x64) | `nkit2iso_<ver>_linux_amd64.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) | `nkit2iso_<ver>_macos_universal.tar.gz` |

### macOS: clear the quarantine flag

The macOS binary is **not code-signed** (that needs a paid Apple Developer
account). After unpacking, remove the quarantine attribute once:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./nkit2iso
```

Otherwise Gatekeeper will refuse to run it. This is expected for open-source
CLI tools distributed outside the App Store.

## Usage

```
nkit2iso -i <in.nkit.iso> [-o <out.iso>] [-f]

  -i   input .nkit.iso file (may also be given as a positional argument)
  -o   output .iso file (default: input name with a .iso extension)
  -f   overwrite the output file if it already exists
  -version   print version and exit
```

Examples:

```sh
# Explicit output
nkit2iso -i game.nkit.iso -o game.iso

# Default output (game.nkit.iso -> game.iso)
nkit2iso -i game.nkit.iso

# Positional input
nkit2iso game.nkit.iso

# GCZ-compressed input (decompressed on the fly)
nkit2iso game.nkit.gcz          # -> game.iso
```

The exit code is `0` only when the reconstructed ISO's CRC32 matches the value
stored in the NKit header. Any mismatch or error exits non-zero and the
half-written output is removed.

## How it works

If the input is a `.gcz` container (Dolphin's block-compressed format, as
produced by `*.nkit.gcz`), `nkit2iso` first inflates it on the fly with the
standard-library zlib — one block at a time, constant memory — and feeds the
resulting nkit stream straight into the restore below.

An NKit v01 GameCube image is a normal disc image with all reproducible data
removed to shrink it:

- **Junk padding** — the pseudo-random filler Nintendo writes between and after
  files. It is fully determined by the 4-byte game ID and disc number, so
  `nkit2iso` regenerates it exactly rather than storing it.
- **Gaps** — inter-file gaps are run-length encoded; any non-reproducible bytes
  (scrubbed regions, partial junk) are preserved inline.
- **All-junk files** — files whose entire contents are junk are dropped from the
  image and rebuilt on restore.

Restoration parses the file system table (FST), streams each preserved file back
into place, regenerates junk and gaps to rebuild the original disc layout, and
rewrites the FST/header offsets to their original values. The whole image is
streamed with constant memory, then CRC32-checked against the header.

For **Wii**, each partition's filesystem is rebuilt the same way in *decrypted*
space, then `nkit2iso` regenerates the H0–H3 SHA-1 hash tree, re-encrypts every
0x8000 cluster with the partition's AES title key, restores scrubbed regions, and
reconstructs the partition table. Only stdlib crypto (`crypto/aes`, `crypto/sha1`)
is used — still zero external dependencies.

## Limitations

- **Wii images with the update partition removed.** Some Wii `.nkit.iso` files
  were shrunk by dropping the update (system-menu/IOS) partition, whose data is
  not stored in the file and cannot be regenerated. Restoring these byte-exact
  needs the matching external Redump recovery partition (`*_<CRC8>`). `nkit2iso`
  detects this and reports it rather than emitting a wrong image.

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.24+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DonMikone/NKIT-Converter
cd NKIT-Converter
go build -o nkit2iso .
go test ./...     # junk-PRNG, Wii common-key and hash-tree self-checks
```

The NKit format and its GameCube/Wii algorithms were created by **Nanook**
([Nanook/NKitv1](https://github.com/Nanook/NKitv1)). `nkit2iso` is an independent,
clean-room Go reimplementation of the *algorithms* (no source code was copied)
built for cross-platform, dependency-free restoration.
